RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline for Glucocorticoid Response in Asthma
 
Overview
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease in which glucocorticoids are widely used as controller medications, yet some patients particularly those with severe or refractory disease—show limited therapeutic response. The reference study investigated transcriptomic responses to glucocorticoid exposure in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells derived from donors with fatal asthma and donors without asthma, identifying extensive differential gene expression and a distinct glucocorticoid-response signature enriched in immune-related pathways.
This project implements an independently designed RNA-seq analysis pipeline to reproduce a selected subset of those computational results. Using a limited sample set and a fully custom workflow, the data were reprocessed and key analytical outputs associated with glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional changes were regenerated.
The pipeline is modular, reproducible, and designed to run under constrained computational resources using a controlled Conda environment and stepwise processing strategy.
Main outputs
•	Gene-level count matrix
•	Differential expression results
•	Volcano plot

Windows users
Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):
https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install
Installing Conda
Install Anaconda or Miniconda for your operating system:
•	macOS: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
•	Windows: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
After installation, open a terminal (macOS / Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows).
 
Environment setup
Place environment.yml in your working directory and run in your command line:
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate myenv
All commands must be executed inside the activated environment.
 
Gene annotation file
A Homo sapiens gene annotation file is required and provided in the repository(refrences).
Ensure it is present in the working directory before running the pipeline.
 
RNA-seq preprocessing and quantification
Run:
bash scripts/salmon_fastp_pipeline.sh
This step:
•	downloads SRA data
•	converts reads to FASTQ
•	performs trimming and QC (fastp)
•	generates QC reports
•	performs Salmon pseudoalignment and quantification
Outputs include:
•	raw SRA files
•	trimmed FASTQ files
•	QC reports
•	Salmon quant.sf files
 
Generate gene symbol identifier mapping
After quantification, construct:
•	Allgene_ids.csv (version-cleaned identifiers)
•	gtf.mapping.csv (mapping file)
These are used for transcript-to-gene aggregation.
 
Count matrix construction
The gene-level count matrix is generated by aggregating Salmon transcript-level quantification.
Two annotation resources are required:
1.	Standardized gene identifiers
Ensembl identifiers may contain version suffixes (e.g., .1, .2).
These are removed using sed to produce a consistent identifier list (ALLgene_ids.csv).
2.	Transcript-to-gene mapping file
Extracted from quant.sf outputs (gtf.mapping.csv) to link transcripts with gene symbols.
Using these resources, transcript abundances are aggregated into a gene-level count matrix (genes × samples).
 
Downstream analysis
Run:
python scripts/analysis.py
This step performs:
•	count matrix processing
•	metadata integration
•	PyDESeq2 differential expression analysis
•	visualization generation
 
Computational workflow (Python stage)
Salmon quantification
→ transcript-to-gene aggregation
→ gene count matrix
→ metadata integration
→ PyDESeq2 object
→ differential expression results
→ visualization (volcano plot, heatmap)
 
Results
The pipeline successfully generated gene-level expression profiles and identified differential expression patterns between experimental conditions.
Both upregulated and downregulated genes were observed. Volcano plots and heatmaps revealed distinct expression patterns and sample clustering consistent with treatment effects.
Functional enrichment analysis identified pathways related to immune signaling and inflammatory processes associated with asthma biology.
Due to the limited sample size, statistical power was reduced and enrichment p-values were generally higher than in the reference study. However, directional expression trends and biologically relevant pathway associations remained consistent with known disease mechanisms.
 
Limitations
•	Reduced sample size limits statistical power
•	Workflow differs from reference implementation
•	Resource-constrained computational environment
•	Enrichment results should be interpreted cautiously
 
Conclusion
This project demonstrates that key transcriptional response patterns associated with glucocorticoid exposure in asthma can be reproduced using an independent RNA-seq analysis pipeline. Despite reduced statistical power and methodological differences, biologically meaningful gene expression trends and pathway enrichment were observed.
The pipeline provides a reproducible and modular framework for RNA-seq analysis under practical computational constraints and serves as an educational implementation of transcriptomic data processing, differential expression analysis, and functional interpretation.
