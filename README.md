RNA-seq Analysis Pipeline for Glucocorticoid Response in Asthma
Overview

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease in which glucocorticoids are widely used as controller medications. However, some patients — particularly those with severe or refractory disease — show limited therapeutic response.

The reference study investigated transcriptomic responses to glucocorticoid exposure in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells derived from donors with fatal asthma and from non-asthmatic donors. The study identified extensive differential gene expression and a distinct glucocorticoid-response signature enriched in immune-related pathways.

This project implements an independently designed RNA-seq analysis pipeline to reproduce a selected subset of those computational findings. Using a limited sample set and a fully custom workflow, raw data were reprocessed and key analytical outputs associated with glucocorticoid-induced transcriptional changes were regenerated.

The pipeline is modular, reproducible, and designed to operate under constrained computational resources using a controlled Conda environment and stepwise processing.

System Requirements

macOS (10+) or Linux

8 GB RAM minimum

256 GB storage recommended

Terminal command line

Conda (Anaconda or Miniconda)

Windows Users

Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL):
https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install

Installing Conda

Install Anaconda or Miniconda for your operating system:

macOS / Linux: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Windows: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

After installation, open a terminal (macOS/Linux) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows).

Environment Setup

Place environment.yml in your working directory and run:

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate myenv

All pipeline commands must be executed inside the activated environment.

Gene Annotation File

A Homo sapiens gene annotation file is required and provided in the references/ directory.
Ensure it is present in the working directory before running the pipeline.

RNA-seq Preprocessing and Quantification

Run:

bash scripts/salmon_fastp_pipeline.sh

This step:

Downloads SRA data

Converts reads to FASTQ

Performs trimming and quality control (fastp)

Generates QC reports

Performs Salmon pseudoalignment and quantification

Outputs

Raw SRA files

Trimmed FASTQ files

QC reports

Salmon quant.sf files

Gene Identifier and Mapping Generation

After quantification, the following files are constructed:

ALLgene_ids.csv — version-cleaned gene identifiers

gtf.mapping.csv — transcript-to-gene mapping file

These files enable transcript-to-gene aggregation.

Count Matrix Construction

Gene-level counts are generated by aggregating Salmon transcript-level quantification.

Required Annotation Resources

1. Standardized gene identifiers
Ensembl gene identifiers may include version suffixes (e.g., .1, .2).
These are removed using sed to create consistent identifiers (ALLgene_ids.csv).

2. Transcript-to-gene mapping file
Extracted from quant.sf outputs (gtf.mapping.csv) to link transcripts to gene symbols.

Using these resources, transcript abundances are aggregated into a gene-level count matrix (genes × samples).

Downstream Analysis

Run:

python scripts/analysis.py

This step performs:

Count matrix processing

Metadata integration

Differential expression analysis using PyDESeq2

Visualization generation

Computational Workflow (Python Stage)

Salmon quantification
→ transcript-to-gene aggregation
→ gene count matrix
→ metadata integration
→ PyDESeq2 object
→ differential expression results
→ visualization (volcano plot, heatmap)

Results

The pipeline generated gene-level expression profiles and identified differential expression patterns between experimental conditions.

Both upregulated and downregulated genes were observed. Volcano plots and heatmaps revealed distinct expression patterns and sample clustering consistent with treatment effects.

Functional enrichment analysis identified pathways related to immune signaling and inflammatory processes associated with asthma biology.

Due to the limited sample size, statistical power was reduced and enrichment p-values were generally higher than in the reference study. However, directional expression trends and biologically relevant pathway associations remained consistent with known disease mechanisms.

Limitations

Reduced sample size limits statistical power

Workflow differs from reference implementation

Resource-constrained computational environment

Enrichment results should be interpreted cautiously

Conclusion

This project demonstrates that key transcriptional response patterns associated with glucocorticoid exposure in asthma can be reproduced using an independent RNA-seq analysis pipeline. Despite reduced statistical power and methodological differences, biologically meaningful gene expression trends and pathway enrichment were observed.

The pipeline provides a reproducible and modular framework for RNA-seq analysis under practical computational constraints and serves as an educational implementation of transcriptomic data processing, differential expression analysis, and functional interpretation.
